# Introduction

* Monads are a technique from functional programming for articulating
  computations into layers

For instance, imagine you are building a calculator program that
  evaluates artithmetic expressions.  You write code that performs
  addition, subtraction, and multiplication, so that you can evaluate
  expressions such as '(* 2 (+ (- 4 2) 3))'.
